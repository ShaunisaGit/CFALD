Why CFALD Works

Many DSLR astrophotographers are limited not by optical resolution, but by noise. Read noise, colour channel imbalance, and demosaicing artefacts often dominate faint extended structures such as galaxy arms and nebulae long before sampling limits are reached.

CFALD addresses this by deliberately trading spatial resolution for signal-to-noise ratio.

A Bayer CFA records four colour-filtered measurements in each 2×2 RGGB block. Under typical seeing-limited, undersampled DSLR conditions, these samples are highly correlated and dominated by noise rather than independent spatial information.

Instead of demosaicing these values into RGB pixels and introducing interpolation noise, CFALD simply bins the raw CFA values to form a single luminance measurement per 2×2 block. This increases SNR, smooths DSLR noise, and avoids all demosaic artefacts.

The result is a low-noise luminance image that is not intended to preserve star resolution. Stars lose resolution when binned and are therefore masked out or removed (e.g. with StarNet++). The CFALD luminance is used only for extended structures, where the SNR improvement produces a clear and visible benefit.

CFALD does not perform super-resolution, drizzle, or detail reconstruction. It makes no claim to preserve high spatial frequencies. It is simply a practical luminance-extraction method for noisy DSLR data.

In short:

Resolution is intentionally reduced

Noise is significantly reduced

Demosaic artefacts are avoided

Extended structures benefit directly

Stars are handled separately

For DSLR users struggling with noisy luminance and faint detail, this trade-off is often worthwhile.
